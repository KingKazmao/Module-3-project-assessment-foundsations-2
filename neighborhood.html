		<h1>My neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
			My neighborhood is actually a pretty small town, its quiet, i went to school with the same 20 kids from kindergarten through 8th grade, so all i can say is that my neighborhood is a small town in the woods. its got a pizza place called massos and thats about it!
